This is a prototype of a brainfuck compiler implemented in python which just uses the basics of it, so you are only able to write your own brainfuck code and compile it through this project, but you will not be able to see memory and more cool functionalities which will be implemented in a new version made in the browser that will be fully dynamic to the user.
